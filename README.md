# thunderbirds-campaign
A campaign mode add-on for the Thunderbirds cooperative board game.

Repository deployed to Github Pages at: [https://eclectic-matt.github.io/thunderbirds-campaign/]

Test the game itself at: [https://eclectic-matt.github.io/thunderbirds-campaign/game.html]

## Idea
A full campaign mode with app which handles the Hood's actions, Schemes and events - providing a longer, deeper challenge for players.
